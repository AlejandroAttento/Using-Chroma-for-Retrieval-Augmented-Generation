# Using Chroma for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
This repository demonstrates a simple implementation of using the Chroma vector database to store information locally. The stored data is then utilized in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution, combining LangChain for orchestration and a QA retriever for querying.

Requirements
* A `.env` file with an OpenAI API token named `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required.
